1. 🎯 Objective
Build a minimal, mobile-first CRM to help solo contractors track clients, job notes, follow-ups, and job status without the bloat of enterprise CRMs or scheduling apps. The app should focus on ease of use, offline-friendly workflows, and speed.

2. 🧑‍💼 Target Users
General handypeople

Mobile service providers (cleaners, notaries, dog walkers, photographers)

Gig workers juggling repeat clients

Blue-collar contractors who are not “tech people”

Managing fewer than 100 clients at a time

3. 🧩 Core Features (MVP Scope)
3.1 Client Management
Add new client (name, phone, email, address)

Edit client info

List view of all clients (sortable by recent activity)

3.2 Job Notes
For each client:

Free-text note field

Photo upload

Optional voice memo attachment (v2)

Date-stamped entries

3.3 Follow-Up Reminders
Add a “next step” (e.g., “Call to confirm”)

Schedule date/time

Local notification or email reminder

3.4 Job Status
Dropdown or tags: “Lead”, “Quoted”, “Scheduled”, “Completed”, “Paid”

Default filter = active jobs

3.5 Location Integration
Store job site address per client

Button to open Google Maps with one tap

3.6 Minimal Dashboard
Today’s follow-ups

Quick jump to clients by status

“Add Client” button always visible

4. ⚙️ Technical Requirements
Frontend:
Framework: React or React Native (mobile-first)

Components: TailwindCSS or simple inline styling

PWA-friendly (if web)

Backend:
Database: Supabase (Postgres, auth, storage)

Auth: Supabase Auth or Clerk.dev

Storage: Supabase (for photos)

Optional: Firebase Cloud Messaging for push notifications (or local notifications in React Native)

Email (SMTP or SendGrid for reminders)

5. 💳 Monetization (Optional for MVP, but ready)
Stripe integration for tiered plans:

Free: up to 5 clients

Pro: $15/month unlimited

No user management or billing dashboard needed in v1—use manual Stripe Checkout links or Payhip
